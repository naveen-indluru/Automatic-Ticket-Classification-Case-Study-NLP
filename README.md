# Automatic Ticket Classification - NLP Case Study

This project focuses on building an **automatic ticket classification** system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The aim is to classify customer support tickets into relevant categories to improve efficiency.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Classify support tickets into predefined categories using NLP and machine learning.
- **Dataset**: Provided by Kaggle with labeled ticket data.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NLTK, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), etc.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/naveen-indluru/Automatic-Ticket-Classification-Case-Study-NLP.git>

## Usage

- Preprocess the dataset (e.g., tokenization, stopword removal).
- Train the model using the training data.
- Evaluate the model performance on the test data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing (tokenization, removing stopwords).
- Ticket classification using various machine learning models.
- Detailed model performance evaluation.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests for improvements.
